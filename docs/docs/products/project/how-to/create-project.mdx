Before creating NFT collections, tokens, and more, the first thing to do should be to create a project with the `createProject` function.
`createProject` takes an object of type `Build5Request<`[`ProjectCreateRequest`](../../../search-post/interfaces/ProjectCreateRequest.md)`>` as parameter.

```tsx file=../../../../../packages/sdk/examples/create_project.ts#L11-L24
```
