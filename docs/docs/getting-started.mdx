Build.5 API provides various ways to interact with our platform. Of course, you can read IOTA/Shimmer directly or use our friendly APIs or the Build.5 SDK directly to simplify access.

## SDK

The recommend way to interact with Build.5 is to use our library. Just add it to your project and get startet:

```bash npm2yarn
npm i @build-5/sdk
npm i @build-5/interfaces
```

## API

There are REST APIs to simplify read and write operations. See following:
- [GET](search-get) - Use this APIs to get any data from Build.5
- [WSS](search-get) - Any [GET](search-get) can be requested as wss:// to receive web socket with real-time updates
- [POST](search-post) - Use these APIs to post any requests to Build.5 (alternative to [OTR](search-otr))

:::info

We are in the progress of migriting to so called On Tangle Requests(OTR). Read more about them [here](on-tangle-request)

:::

We provide two endpoints. One for testing and one for production. See below:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="production" label="Production Endpoint" default>

```
https://api.build5.com
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="testing" label="Testing Endpoint">

```
https://api-test.build5.com
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> Make sure to consider [API's limitations](limitations)

Let's do a simple GET Request to get the member's object of `@adam_unchained`:

```
import { Build5, https } from '@build-5/sdk';
import { Dataset } from '@build-5/interfaces';

const member = await https(origin).createProject(<YourProjectApiKey>)
                                  .dataset(Dataset.MEMBER)
                                  .id('0x551fd2c7c7bf356bac194587dab2fcd46420054b')
                                  .get();

console.log(member);
```
