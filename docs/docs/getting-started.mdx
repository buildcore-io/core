Build.5 API provides various ways to interact with our platform. The recommended one is the [@build-5/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@build-5/sdk) which interacts through a REST API and our so called [OTRs](#otr) with the Build.5 platform.

## SDK

Just add the SDK to your project and get startet:

```bash npm2yarn
npm i @build-5/sdk
npm i @build-5/interfaces
```

The sdk is split into two modules to interact with the Build.5 platform. `otr` and `https`. Checkout the following sections to lern more.

## OTR

On tangle requests are a secure and transparent way to interact with build.5 products. They are a way to send a request to a build.5 backend over the Tangle as a transaction. 
The backend will then execute the request encoded in the OTR. All interactions can be verified on the Tangle.

To use OTR with the SDK you need to choose an OTR Address and create an [otrWrapper](./reference-api/classes/OtrWrapper.md) object. Checkout this small example:
```tsx file=../../packages/sdk/examples/basic_otr.ts
```

:::info Development Environment

You can specify the environment you want to work in, by using the specific OTR Address. In the SDK you can use the [Build5OtrAddress enum](./reference-api/enums/Build5OtrAddress.md) to get the correct address.

## HTTPS

The SDK also provides a wrapper for BUILD.5s API.

:::info

We are in the process of migrating POST requests to OTR.

To interact with the API you need to choose an endpoint you want to connect to and create an `httpsWrapper` object.
Let's do a simple GET Request to get the member's object of `Santa Claus`:
```tsx file=../../packages/sdk/examples/basic_https.ts
```

We provide two endpoints. One for testing and one for production.  In the SDK you can access them with the [Build5 enum](./reference-api/enums/Build5.md). You can also find them here:

<Tabs groupId="environment">
  <TabItem value="production" label="Production Endpoint">
    <pre><code>
      {Build5.PROD}
    </code></pre>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="testing" label="Testing Endpoint">
    <pre><code>
      {Build5.TEST}
    </code></pre>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

> Make sure to consider [API's limitations](limitations)

:::info API Keys

To work with the API you need access keys which you can get by [creating a project](./how-to/project/create-project.mdx).
You can also use public Soonaverse keys to test against live community driven project. In the SDK you can access the following Keys through the [SoonaverseApiKey constant](./reference-api/modules#soonaverseapikey):

:::

<Tabs groupId="environment">
  <TabItem value="production" label="Production Key">
    <pre><code>
      {SoonaverseApiKey[Build5.PROD]}
    </code></pre>
  </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="testing" label="Testing Key">
      <pre><code>
        {SoonaverseApiKey[Build5.TEST]}
      </code></pre>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
