On tangle requests are a secure and transparent way to interact with build.5 products. They are a way to send a request to a build.5 backend over the Tangle. The backend will then execute the request. All interactions can be verified on the Tangle.

OTR uses metadata to describe the request. The metadata is a JSON object. You can find the API reference for the metadata [here](search-otr), but we recommend using our [SDK](https://developer.build5.com/docs/getting_started#sdk).

## Why OTR?

By utilizing On Tangle Requests (OTRs), we are [preparing](architecture) for the future integration of Smart Contracts into our system. OTRs provide a transparent and visible way to interact with build.5 products enhance security by enabling all interactions to be verified on the Tangle. By adopting OTRs, you can ensure a more future-proof approach and minimize the need for extensive refactoring or UI changes.
