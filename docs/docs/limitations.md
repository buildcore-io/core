<InProgress/>

We only allow:

- unlimited number of requests on OTR through Tangle - recommended! 
- maximum of 50 requests per second on GET requests
- maximum of 5 requests per second on POST requests

If you need higher throughput make sure to reach out to use so we can enable higher throughput for you. 

This limits are necessary to avoid abuse and dDos attacks.
