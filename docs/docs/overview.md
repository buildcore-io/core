Welcome to the BUILD.5 documentation.
We recommend you to start with [Getting Started](getting_started) page.

Build.5 product have been evolved over two years starting on IOTA Mainnet. The most of it's features were migrated to support Stardust on the Shimmer. Once Startdust is enabled on IOTA mainnet Build.5 product will enable all Stardust features on Mainnet as well.

Meanwhile, [our architecture](architecture) continue to be designed to fully adopt any new features build on IOTA/Shimmer L1 and L2. Our primarily focus is always L1 as we believe it gives us significant advantage within the DLT ecosystem. Ultimately our execution logic would be fully migrated into L1 and L2 Smart Contracts once the technology is available.

As you can see in current design, asset management, custody and more are directly created/managed within the DLT. Build.5 just provides execution layer to limit the exposure to centralized piece. Even things like token buy/sell is settle directly on L1 and we continue to push it's limits.

We're an open source project operating out of Switzerland non-profit Association. Join us in the effort to build the best "Enterprise ready web3 plug & play platform".
