To create a member, you need to call `createMember`.
`createMember` takes an object of type [`Build5Request`](../../../reference-api/interfaces/Build5Request)`<`[`CreateMemberRequest`](../../../reference-api/interfaces/CreateMemberRequest.md)`>` as parameter.


```tsx file=../../../../../packages/sdk/examples/member/create.ts#L7-L13
```
