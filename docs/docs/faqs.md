## Is Build.5 Open Sourced?

All BUILD.5 code is developed under Apache.2 license and fully open sourced.

## Why OTR?

By utilizing On Tangle Requests (OTRs), we are [preparing](./architecture.md) for the future integration of Smart Contracts into our system. OTRs provide a transparent and visible way to interact with build.5 products enhance security by enabling all interactions to be verified on the Tangle. By adopting OTRs, you can ensure a more future-proof approach and minimize the need for extensive refactoring or UI changes.
