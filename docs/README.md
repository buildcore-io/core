# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

> [!NOTE]
> The docs use modern [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). So don't forget to run `corepack enable` first if you don't have it already.

> [!NOTE]
> To use the docs you have to [build](../README.md) the packages first.
