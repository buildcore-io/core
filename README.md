# Overview

Soonaverse platform:
- Dao As a Service
- Academy
- Platform Station

## Framework
Application is designed to eventually transition fully into the ISCP and away from any centralized services. Centralized services are transitioned as infrastructure becomes ready for production use.

There are three key frameworks:

### /protocol
Solidity Smart Contracts. Hardhat is used to manage testing, migration, deployments, etc.

### /functions
Interim centralized TypeScript functions that runs on Firebase Cloud Functions.

### /src
Front-end application in Angular. It uses @api to connect to protocol & firestore (interim).
